# Certificate of Quantitative Finance (CQF) - June 2025 Cohort

**Author:** Jing Zhong LIU  
**Cohort:** June 2025  
**Institute:** CQF Institute / Fitch Learning

## 📖 Repository Overview
This repository serves as a comprehensive archive of my coursework, examinations, and final capstone project for the **Certificate of Quantitative Finance (CQF)** program. It demonstrates practical implementations of quantitative models, machine learning algorithms in finance, and portfolio management strategies.

## 📂 Project Structure

### 1. [Exam 1: Portfolio Management & Data Analysis](./Exam1)
* **Focus:** Fundamental quantitative analysis and portfolio optimization.
* **Key Files:**
    * `E1_JINGZHONGLIU_REPORT.pdf`: Formal coursework report detailing the methodology and results.
    * `E1_JINGZHONGLIU_CODE.ipynb`: Python implementation of the analysis.
    * `Data/`: Historical data for **S&P 500** and **NASDAQ 100** used for analysis.

### 2. [Exam 2: Derivatives & Option Pricing](./Exam2)
* **Focus:** Equity derivatives pricing, risk-neutral valuation, and hedging.
* **Key Files:**
    * `E2.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing pricing models (e.g., Black-Scholes, Binomial Trees) and sensitivity analysis.

### 3. [Exam 3: Fixed Income & Advanced Models](./Exam3)
* **Focus:** Stochastic interest rate modeling, fixed income securities, or credit risk models.
* **Key Files:**
    * `report.pdf`: Formal examination report and answers for Exam 3.

### 4. [Final Project: Machine Learning in Finance](./Final%20Project)
**Title:** Hierarchical Ensemble System for SPY Prediction
* **Overview:** A comprehensive study applying advanced machine learning techniques to predict S&P 500 ETF (SPY) movements.
* **Methodology:**
    * **Feature Engineering:** Implemented **Fractional Differentiation** (d=0.4) to preserve memory while achieving stationarity.
    * **Model Architecture:** Constructed a **Two-Layer Blending Ensemble** classifier integrating Logistic Regression, Random Forest, LightGBM, XGBoost, and Gradient Boosting.
    * **Unsupervised Learning:** Utilized **Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)** for feature dimensionality reduction and clustering.
* **Key Findings:**
    * Achieved a **Sharpe Ratio of 1.43** in out-of-sample testing.
    * Post-trade attribution analysis revealed that performance was primarily driven by **Regime-Based Risk Overlays (Trend Filtering)** rather than raw predictive accuracy.
